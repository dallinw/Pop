<a href="https://github.com/dallinw/Pop/blob/master/pop.app" download>Pop</a> is a 
polyphonic, pentatonic synthesizer. It modulates four sine waves along a
set of exponential functions to follow the notes of the pentatonic scale. A master 
frequency and volume control (green) are included in addition to individual 
controls for each voice (blue). It also features a distortion with adjustable drive
level and tremolo with adjustable rate.
 
The ADSR envelope is included in the GUI but not yet fully implemented. 
ADSR.h and ADSR.cpp come from Nigel Redmon at <a href="earlevel.com">earlevel.com</a>.

Future possibilities for Pop include:
<ul>
<li>Fixing the ADSR envelope</li>
<li>VST/AU versions for cross-platform use</li>
<li>Adding a cutoff adjustment</li>
<li>Adding reverb</li>
<li>Adding square, sawtooth, and/or triangle waves</li>
<li>Cleaning up some of the uglier parts of this code :D</li>
</ul>
